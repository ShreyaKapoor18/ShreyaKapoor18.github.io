My experience at ICLR 2025

Day 0: Reached my hotel (Village Hotel Changi) from the great Singapore Changi Airport, which is an architectural marvel. The Singapore Changi Airport was all green and sustainable (you can call it Biophilic)

The hotel was fully booked for the Conference. I chose this hotel for the experience of its Infinity Pool.

I reached the conference in the morning at 8:30 am, while there was still time to register at the desks without a queue. The Halls were huge and almost felt like concert halls. The conference was well organized, and we were getting checked for our badges at the entry point of each hall.

Talk by Zico Kolter: Building Safe and Robust AI systems, which was a super cool talk about how to make an impact with academic research. He discussed papers that fundamentally transformed the field of Machine Learning and AI. He talked about AlphaGo, Adam Optimizers, and the fact that the papers which influenced his career are not the ones that transformed the field of machine learning. In 2015, whatever was launched really transformed the field, and now that spark is a bit lost in 2025. The industry is a big player in the field of ML, and one could see at the conference that the community is close-knit with the industry.

Mentorship Hour 

The mentorship hour was a great way to get to know more people working in the field and stay connected with what is happening currently. Also, it was helpful for navigating your career and job prospects.

The whole day was very tiring but also very interesting, where I got to know about everything correctly.

Day 2: Conference Day 2

1. Talk: Pursuing the nature of intelligence 
2. Poster Session 
3. WiML social (Women in Machine Learning Social)
    It was great to talk about Machine Learning with women from all over the world, as well as about dual-career couples and finding a position at the same university as one wishes, and the transition from academia to industry and industry to academia, and so on ðŸ™‚.

4. Test of Time award: for the Adam Optimizer 
5. Visit to the Changi Beach near my hotel after the conference got over 

Day 3: Conference Day 3 

Training LLMs in Academia: Challenging or Calling 
I really enjoyed this talk since it opened my eyes to training LLMs on a tight budget, but also that the academic budget opens room for innovation.

Poster Session 
Town Hall 
Mentorship Hour 
Salesforce Party: to which I gained access via the Online Whova App

Day 4: 

All Day: the Second Re-Align Workshop where I presented my paper: Computer Graphics from a Neuroscientistâ€™s perspective [cite: 14]. This included a series of talks on Representational Alignment between humans and machines [cite: 14] and the opening of a hackathon.

After the conference: SfN Singapore Chapter 
I reached the medical drive, which was 1.5 hours from my hotel. I loved the superb environment of the medical drive, which included a poster session and paper presentation and stimulating talks in Neuroscience.

Things common for all days 

Superb food! The conference itself provided food whose menu changed every 3 hours â€“ something we really miss in Europe is good food!
