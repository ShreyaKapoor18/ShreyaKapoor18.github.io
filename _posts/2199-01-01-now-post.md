So, I have travelled to multiple conferences as a part of my research career, but the M2L summer school 2025 was a bit special for me. I enjoyed every bit of the Summer Schoool. 
It was super exciting to visit the Mediterenean countries and also see the enthusiasm of undergraduates. Before the summer school started, we got an invitation to the slack and 
also the whole schedule of the summer school which was nothing short of great! 

On the first day, we flew to Split, Croatia and checked into the dorms provided by the university. The weather was Mediterenean (and sweaty, hence my hair was very itchy).
I was not that tired from my flight hence we went to the Gala dinner organized by the team of the summer school at Gal Split
