“Minimal Recognizable Configurations Elicit Category-selective Responses in Higher Order Visual Cortex” introduces the concept of Minimal Recognizable Configurations (MIRCs), as presented by Shimon Ullman et al. A MIRC is defined as the smallest visual configuration of image components that remains reliably recognizable as belonging to a specific category.

I really liked the idea of these MIRCs, it shows how we can crop and change the resolution of the image and still recognize objects from it. The paper analyzses to what extent can we go
that the configuration becomes unrecognizable at all! To what extent can we boil it down.
