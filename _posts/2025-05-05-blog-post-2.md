Welcome to my personal recap of attending [ICLR 2025](https://iclr.cc/) in Singapore! This write-up blends my reflections, highlights from the conference, and a bit of travelogue from one of the most exciting tech and research hubs in the world.

## Day 0: Arrival in Singapore

- **Landed at Singapore Changi Airport**, an architectural and biophilic marvel. The airport was lush, sustainable, and full of natural light—truly a unique experience.

- **Stayed at Village Hotel Changi**, known for its serene location and *infinity pool*.

- **Expectations vs. Reality:** The pool looked more scenic online than in person, especially at night with fewer views of the beach.
- The hotel was fully booked with conference attendees, which added to the excitement.
- A/C everywhere! A bit too cold at times.
- Grab rides made commuting easy—I used Grab regularly between the venue and hotel.

- The **halls were massive**, like concert venues, and well-organized with badge checks at every entry point.

### Keynote: *Building Safe and Robust AI Systems*

- A brilliant talk about impactful academic research.
- Reflections on landmark papers: *AlphaGo*, *Adam Optimizer*, etc.
- The speaker noted that the true transformative phase of ML was around 2015, and that the current landscape feels more driven by industry than academia.

###  Poster Sessions

- Insightful conversations and visual overviews of the latest research.

### 🏢 Industry Booths

- Tech giants were present in full force—Google, Meta, Salesforce, and more.

### 🤝 Mentorship Hour
