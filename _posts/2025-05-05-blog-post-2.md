## ✈️ Day 0: Arrival in Singapore

- **Landed at Singapore Changi Airport**, an architectural and biophilic marvel. The airport was lush, sustainable, and full of natural light—truly a unique experience.

- **Stayed at Village Hotel Changi**, known for its serene location and *infinity pool*.

  - Expectations vs. Reality: The pool looked more scenic online than in person, especially at night with fewer views of the beach.
  - The hotel was fully booked with conference attendees, which added to the excitement.
  - A/C everywhere! A bit too cold at times.
  - Grab rides made commuting easy—I used Grab regularly between the venue and hotel.
