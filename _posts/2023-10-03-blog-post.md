So after ICLR 2025 in Singapore, I visited the SfN (Society for Neuroscience Chapter) in Singapore at the A* Star institute which was nothing beyond 
amazing. The facilities at the institute were world class and I got to meet some of the best researchers in Neuroscience there, and alongside
present my work! I was happy to have 20 people at my poster with great discusssions about something new that we were putting forward. 
I am glad I got the chance to visit Singapore for this conference as it was once in a lifetime opportunity for me! 

Here is my presentation after visiting the SfN Singapore chapter!
