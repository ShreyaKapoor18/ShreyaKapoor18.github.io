I am actively looking for Data Science and Machine learning roles in Data Science and Computer Vision. I aim to explore Data Science, ML and AI roles in the industrial sector. 


Prior to this, I worked as a Research Scientist in the Learning in Early Childhood group at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. There, I led the design of end-to-end pipelines for processing Neuroimaging data, merging technical expertise with insights into human cognitive development.  

I hold a B.Sc. (Hons) in Physics (2018) and an M.Sc. in Life Science Informatics (2020). My transition from Physics to Life Science Informatics reflects my passion for exploring unconstrained and complex systems like the human brain.  

Beyond academics, I thrive on connecting with people and gaining fresh perspectives. In my free time, I enjoy reading popular science literature and expressing myself through dance. Currently, I am also exploring AI applications for the industry

- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Computer Science, ML and Bioinformatics!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects.
- 💬 Ask me about Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Cognitive Science.

# Activities and Highlights

## I attended VMV 2025 as a helper and organizer at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg
-----

### I will be serving as reviewer for UniReps 2025 conference
--------
### M2L Summer School, Croatia  
I will be attending the M2L Summer School in Croatia from **September 8–12, 2025**. I am really excited to meet all the scientists and researchers there.

------

### Cohere Summer School Online  
I will be attending the [Cohere Summer School Online](https://sites.google.com/cohere.com/coherelabs-community/community-programs/summer-school) and hope to remain connected with the community!

--------

### ICLR 2025 Presentation  
I had the opportunity to present my work at **ICLR 2025**, one of the premier conferences in machine learning. During the poster session, I showcased my research titled  
**“Computer Graphics from a Neuroscientist’s Perspective”**, engaging with domain experts from both computer science and neuroscience. The constructive feedback and interdisciplinary discussions significantly informed and shaped the next phase of my project.

----------

### Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Chapter, Singapore  
I attended the Society for Neuroscience chapter in Singapore, where I participated in neuroscience outreach, helped organize local events, and fostered interdisciplinary collaboration between computational and biological sciences.
