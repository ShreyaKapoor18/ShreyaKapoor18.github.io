I am actively looking for Data Science and Machine Learning roles in Data Science and Computer Vision. I aim to explore Data Science, ML and AI roles in the industrial sector or a corresponding research position.

Prior to this, I worked as a Research Scientist in the Learning in Early Childhood group at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. There, I led the design of end-to-end pipelines for processing Neuroimaging data, merging technical expertise with insights into human cognitive development.

I hold a B.Sc. (Hons) in Physics (2018) and an M.Sc. in Life Science Informatics (2020). My transition from Physics to Life Science Informatics reflects my passion for exploring unconstrained and complex systems like the human brain.

Beyond academics, I thrive on connecting with people and gaining fresh perspectives. In my free time, I enjoy reading popular science literature and expressing myself through dance. Currently, I am also exploring AI applications for the industry.

The first project which got me interested in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience:
[Alphago, where DeepMind's algorithm defeated Lee Sedol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y&t=1892s). 


- 🌱 I'm currently learning advanced Computer Science, ML and Bioinformatics!
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects.

## Courses I suggest to audit

- [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://slds-lmu.github.io/i2ml/)
- [Computational Visual Perception](https://www.fau.tv/series/computational-visual-perception-w24) - I was also a part of this course as a Teaching Assistant
- [Visual Computing for the Life Sciences](https://cg.cs.uni-bonn.de/person/prof-dr-thomas-schultz) - Offered by Prof. Dr. Thomas Schultz and is one of the best courses I ever attended. I must say that Prof. Schultz is one of the best course instructors I have met or learned from. His slides were always clear, structured and very easy to understand. They made hard concepts in Computer Science available to an audience of non-computer scientists at the Master level which was nothing short of great for the students.
- [Introduction to Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvezxUdLrEk)
- [Introduction to Neuroscience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba-HMvDn_vU)
- [The Brain that Changes Itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK51nv8mo-o&t=72s)  - the first documentary which inspired me about the plasticity of the brain and how are abilities are not fixed over life. We can change it over time with Neurofeedback, also use BCIs (brain computer interfaces) for Neurofeedback!
