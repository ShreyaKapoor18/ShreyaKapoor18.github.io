I am a PhD student at the Cognitive Computer Vision Lab, supervised by Prof. Dr. Bernhard Egger at the University of Erlangen Nuremberg. My research focuses on exploring the interplay between human and machine vision, aiming to uncover both their differences and potential similarities. With a deep interdisciplinary curiosity, my academic journey is driven by a desire to bridge the fields of Computer Vision and AI.


Prior to my PhD, I worked as a Research Scientist in the Learning in Early Childhood group at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany. There, I led the design of end-to-end pipelines for processing Neuroimaging data, merging technical expertise with insights into human cognitive development.  

I hold a B.Sc. (Hons) in Physics (2018) and an M.Sc. in Life Science Informatics (2020). My transition from Physics to Life Science Informatics reflects my passion for exploring unconstrained and complex systems like the human brain.  

Beyond academics, I thrive on connecting with people and gaining fresh perspectives. In my free time, I enjoy reading popular science literature and expressing myself through dance. Currently, I am also exploring AI applications for the industry

## üåü Highlights  

‚ú® **Fun Fact:** I love watching action movies and programming in my free time.  
üéØ **Mission:** Bridging the gap between Computer Vision and Cognitive Science, at the same time learning as much Computer Vision as possible. 

## Recent Highlights

a. I had the opportunity to present my work at ICLR 2025, one of the premier conferences in machine learning. During the poster session, I showcased my research titled ‚ÄúComputer Graphics from a Neuroscientist‚Äôs Perspective‚Äù, engaging with domain experts from both computer science and neuroscience. The constructive feedback and interdisciplinary discussions significantly informed and shaped the next phase of my project.
b. Additionally, I attended the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) chapter in Singapore, participating in neuroscience outreach, organizing local events, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between computational and biological sciences.
c. Selected to attend the Machine Learning Summer School (MLSS) in Split, Croatia (September 8‚Äì12, 2025), a competitive program offering in-depth training in cutting-edge machine learning methods.
